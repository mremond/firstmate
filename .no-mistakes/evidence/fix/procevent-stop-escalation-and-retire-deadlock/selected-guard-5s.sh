# depends on a discovery timer. The Lavish adapter is exercised through its own

# server is started.
#
# Delivery is deliberately NOT asserted as at-least-once or lossless: the
# published Lavish poll clears feedback destructively before returning it, so
# the only durability under test is the runner's own - output that reached the
# runner is stored before it is announced.
