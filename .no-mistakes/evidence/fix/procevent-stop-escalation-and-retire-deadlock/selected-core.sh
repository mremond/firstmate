# --- a stop reaches a child that does not die on the ordinary signal ---------
#
# Every reaper here sends the ordinary stop signal to the runner's process group
# and escalates only if the group outlives it. Both halves of that escalation
# were broken, in ways that hid each other:
#
#   - The stop held the per-source lock across its wait while the runner's own
#     exit cleanup waited for that same lock, so the runner outlived the ordinary
#     signal every time and the forced kill silently became the normal path.
#   - The escalation re-derived ownership from the leader, so once the leader did
#     die to the stop's own signal it read that success as a leaderless group and
#     refused to escalate at all.
#
# With only the first repaired, the second turned every stop of a signal-proof
# child into a refusal that left it running. They are asserted together because
# they only hold together.
#
# Earlier fixtures include TERM-resistant children and deliberately kept-alive
# leaders. The cases below also exercise escalation after TERM ends the leader.

# Millisecond clock for supplementary retirement and stop-window measurements;
# the healthy-stop verdict below requires attached-start status 143 (TERM).
